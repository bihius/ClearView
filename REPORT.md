# implemented functions

# troubles
- Choosing model for the project was a really hard, I didn't choose one so I will use CLIP and Detectron2 simultaneously.
- Everything in this project is new to me, I have to learn a lot of things.
- Many hours spend on trying to find a best way to do something, like testing CLIP, Detectron2, FasterRCNN, many datasets like yolo, coco etc; comparing anything with anything, and so on. I also have to learn how to use jupyter notebook, setup (stable) environment, figuring out not to use fancy projects like supabase.
