# troubles
At first I though about creating a new model, but I realized that would be too much work for the time I have. So I decided to use a pre-trained model. I found the EfficientDet model, which is a state-of-the-art object detection model. I will use it to detect and classify objects on images.
Next trouble is Flask. I have never used it before, so I will have to learn how to use it. 
Like before, I have never used Bulma before, so I will have to learn how to use it (I have some experience with CSS, so I think it will be easier).
